# This is just a test for the article

I am testing some features of astro to try and get a feel for how it works.
The first thing I am testing is the markdown files. I am not sure how to
import them into the site yet, but I am sure I will figure it out.

Now I am going to write some lists:
- This is a list item
-- This is a sub list item
- This is another list item

Now I am going to write some code:
```js
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);
```

Now I am going to write some math:
$$
\begin{align}
x &= 1 \\
y &= 2 \\
z &= x + y \\
\end{align}
$$

Now I am going to write some inline math: $x + y = z$

Now I am going to write some tables:
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Item 1   | Item 2   | Item 3   |
| Item 4   | Item 5   | Item 6   |

Now I am going to write some images:

Now I am going to write some links:
[This is a link](https://www.google.com)

Now I am going to write some blockquotes:
> This is a block quote
> This is another block quote

Now I am going to write some footnotes:
This is a footnote[^1]
    
    [^1]: This is the footnote

Now I am going to write some abbreviations:
This is an abbreviation for HTML: HTML

Now I am going to write some definitions:
This is a definition for HTML:
: HTML is a markup language

Now I am going to write some subscripts:
This is a subscript: H~2~O

Now I am going to write some superscripts:
This is a superscript: 2^2^

Now I am going to write some mark:
This is a mark: ==mark==
